# Endpoints

Throughout this section,
there will be numerous references to certain types,
such as `User` and `Thread`.
These type definitions are _not_ present on those pages;
rather, they can be found in the [type definition section](../types/index.md).
If the language you are using is not found,
you may have to derive the exact type from knowledge of other languages.
Feel free to contribute by converting type definitions into new languages.

Unless otherwise specified,
an endpoint does not require authentication.
